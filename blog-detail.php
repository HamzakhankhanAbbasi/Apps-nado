                    <P class="blogdetail-text2 mt-4 mb-4">Data-driven management is absolutely worth investing one’s time and energies in! Its short term benefits are sweet – its long term advantages are extraordinary!</P>   
                    <p class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">This is a global phenomenon and is known as the Flynn effect, brought on by our constantly increasing exposure to technology.</p> 
                    <P class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">But what actually happens during this exposure to technology? Data processing. Exchange of information.</P>
                    <p class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">The same data, when applied to decision making, acts as a game changer. It enables us to make educated and informed decisions instead of traditional trial-and-error methods.</p>
                    <P class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">In simpler words, the more data you crunch, the better your decision making process becomes.</P>
                    <p class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">Despite speaking highly of data, it is important to take note here that data itself is nothing more than multidimensional, multivariate bits or dots of information. It only makes sense when someone connects these dots together.</p>
                    <p class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">Project Management Offices (PMOs) are incessantly involved with decision making activities. Be it something as subtle as making a small UX change to something as significant as rolling a big feature out at a certain time of the year, it all banks on the Project/Product Manager’s decision-making acumen.</p>
                    <p class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">And it isn’t easy!</p>
                    <p class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">The two prime means through which a Project/Product Manager can get data’s help are:</p>

                    <P class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">Business intelligence (BI) is the act of leveraging data to make well informed business decisions.</P>
                    <p class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">Data is extracted using both software- and process-based mechanisms. It is collected, recorded, analyzed, and then converted into meaningful information.</p>
                    <p class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">BI is considered as a descriptive analysis of data and gives PMs hands-on access to real-time metrics, thus improving visibility into projects, processes, and outcomes.</p>
                    <p class="blog-detail-head mt-4 mb-4">Business Analytics</p> 
                    <p  class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">Business analytics provide relevant metrics and KPIs which can be leveraged to deduce what may happen in the future, when, and why, based on historical data.</p>
                    <p  class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">It is not so easy and not so accurate either. BA is mainly concerned with predictive analyses as compared to BI’s descriptive analyses.</p>
                    <p  class="blogdetail-text2 mb-4">Summing it up, BI is explanatory whereas BA is speculative. BI gives you insight whereas BA gives you foresight.</p>
