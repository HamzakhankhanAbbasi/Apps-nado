He wanted to improve the life style of people, help them make wise decisions and become leaders of tomorrow. Appnsnado was given the responsibility to design an  interactive app with easy and attractive user interface.</p>
							<p class="gray-paragraph">Building one on one and one to multiple                  functionalities while maintaining confidentiality was   a challenge. Additionally, because it was an unusual idea, it was tough to even visualize the functionality and transform the idea into reality. It was also quite challenging to meet the App Store and Play Store guidelines because the app needed to be less native with much cross domain functionalities.</p>

One of the most challenging aspects during the development of Go Mentor was the design direction and conceptualization while considering the target audience. We had to design an app that is trendy, appealing and sophisticated enough to offer individuals a simplistic process. After multiple iterations, our creative team was able to achieve the objectives in the most efficient manner.</p>
